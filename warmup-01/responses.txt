1)  I decided to take this class to polish up on my web development skills.  This summer is my 
last semster before I get a degree in Computer Science so I thought it would be good experience. 
As it stands I have not taken a class formally dedicated to HTML and CSS, so I thought it would be
a good idea to better understand the fundamentals of web development.

2)  I hope to memorize basic syntax and also gain a better grasp on the fundamentals of how
HTML and CSS work together.

3)  The image that I uploaded is a picture of my dog, Willow.  She is about 2 years
old now and I spend the majority of my time with her!
