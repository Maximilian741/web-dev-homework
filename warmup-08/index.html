    The intended purpose of this website is to create an art gallery for my dad.  It is something that he has wanted for some time so I decidied to incorporate it into 
    my education!  I am going to try very hard to get images of his artwork, but he can be slow to respond at times!  These will include his paintings, ceramic works, and drawings.
    If for whatever reason he doesn't get the images to me in time I will include some of his other works that I have at my home.  I may also use genereic placeholder images in the meantime!

    The first image in the top left that you see will be the main page.  I want to include a picture as the main layout with a site title, logo, and navigation bar at the bottom.

    The second image is a model for the sub pages that I am going to have for him. I am going to experiment as I am designing it to see what looks the best.
