            Hey you, out there in the cold
            Getting lonely, getting old
            Can you feel me?
            Hey you, standing in the aisles
            With itchy feet and fading smiles
            Can you feel me?
            Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
            Don't give in without a fight
            Hey you out there on your own
            Sitting naked by the phone
            Would you touch me?
            Hey you with you ear against the wall
            Waiting for someone to call out
            Would you touch me?
            Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
            Open your heart, I'm coming home
            But it was only fantasy
            The wall was too high
            As you can see
            No matter how he tried
            He could not break free
            And the worms ate into his brain
            Hey you, out there on the road
            Always doing what you're told
            Can you help me?
            Hey you, out there beyond the wall
            Breaking bottles in the hall
            Can you help me?
            Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
            Together we stand, divided we fall
        </pre>
